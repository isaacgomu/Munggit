This is my fully working social media page Munggit.

I achieved all of my requirements, and met the stretch goal of being able to visit others timelines and see their posts. I did not implement a like or follow system as I was unsure of it. I made my own custom loading page, I included a Radix UI of a Hover Card, there is a custom error and 404 page.

One thing I would like to do in the future is allow my users to upload images and also change their avatar, but that involves learning about domains which we have not covered yet.
